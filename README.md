# KerbalController
The goal is to create a controller that can be used to play a space game/simulation known as Kerbal Space Program. I made 3 versions of the controller. The previous two were based on Arduinos, and didn’t work well. This time I used a Raspberry Pi, and added a touchscreen, and now it works great, and is wireless. It is still a bit oversized, and I may consider building a fourth, more compact version. The controller communicates to the game via a plugin over the internet, and has a delay of about 100 milliseconds, which certainly isn’t instant but is enough to play the game at. I can control throttle, attitude, maneuver nodes, and much more with this controller with sliders, joysticks, and switches
